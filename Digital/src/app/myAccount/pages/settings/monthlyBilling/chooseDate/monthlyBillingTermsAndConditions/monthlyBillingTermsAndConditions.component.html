        <div class="point-message">
            By requesting monthly billing for one of your energy accounts, you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions for
            that account:
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-1">1.</div>
            <div class="col-xs-11 point-message">
                Your billing cycle will change from quarterly (or bi-monthly for Victorian gas accounts) to monthly. Your confirmation email will specify when this change will occur.
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">2.</div>
            <div class="col-xs-11 point-message">
                You may request a day of the month on which we will issue your bill. You can change the selected day of month, however, AGL may refuse to change the requested day of month if such a change would result in a bill not being issued for more than 1 month.
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">3.</div>
            <div class="col-xs-11 point-message">
                To issue your bill on the day of the month requested, that day and the previous day must be business days. Where we are unable to issue your bill on the day of the month requested, we will issue your bill no later than two business days from the requested day of the month.
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">4.</div>
            <div class="col-xs-11 point-message">
                If the day of the month requested does not exist in a particular month, then we will issue your bill for the period ending on the last day of that month, in accordance with clause 3.
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">5.</div>
            <div class="col-xs-11 point-message">
                Subject to clauses 3 and 4, your first monthly bill will be issued on the requested day of the month. This bill may be for a period of up to 12 weeks depending on your last quarterly bill date. We will issue one further quarterly bill if the requested day of the month falls after your next scheduled quarterly bill date.
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">6.</div>
            <div class="col-xs-11 point-message">
                You will receive your bills each month via email (eBilling). You will not receive bills via post.
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">7.</div>
            <div class="col-xs-11 point-message">
                    If we are unable to base your monthly bill on an actual reading of your meter, we may base your bill on the actual data that is available to us or estimate the meter read for billing purposes. You agree that we may base this estimate upon:
                <div>
                    i. Your own read;
                </div>
                <div>
                    ii. Your historical metering data; or
                </div>
                <div>
                    iii. If there is no historical metering data available, the average usage of energy by a comparable
                    customer over the corresponding period.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">8.</div>
            <div class="col-xs-11 point-message">
                You must continue to provide access to your meter for meter reading purposes.
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">9.</div>
            <div class="col-xs-11 point-message">
                You may contact AGL to cancel your monthly billing arrangements via My Account, by writing to us by post or email at least 5 business days in advance.
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">10.</div>
            <div class="col-xs-11 point-message">
                If you cancel your monthly billing arrangement, your bill cycle will return to a quarterly billing cycle for your account, except for Victorian gas accounts, which will return to a bi-monthly billing cycle. Your next bill following cancellation will be on a quarterly cycle, unless it would be issued more than three months from the date of cancellation. If this is the case then you will receive one last monthly bill before returning to a quarterly bill cycle.
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">11.</div>
            <div class="col-xs-11 point-message">
                Agreeing to a monthly billing arrangement does not affect your payment obligations relating to bill smoothing, payment plans or to any amounts owing on other AGL accounts where you do not have a monthly billing arrangement.
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">12.</div>
            <div class="col-xs-11 point-message">
                Monthly billing may not be available for all contract types, including where supply is unmetered, measured through a standalone bulk hot water meter or measured through a manually read interval meter.
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-1">13.</div>
            <div class="col-xs-11 point-message">
